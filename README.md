# p05-calculator

Vanilla JavaScript project.
To meet the Fullstack Academy requirements this version has a link to the "original calculator" which is the one they specified.
The calculator that open on entry is a twist of my own. It has an RPN mode just because I like RPN calculators and it has a regular mode.
"RPN Example" explains how RPN calculators work for users that may not know.

This project showcases HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coding.
